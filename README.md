I’m Isha Kumari, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at the Central University of Karnataka. I completed my BCA (Honours) from Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University Muzaffarpur and my 10th & 12th from M R D School, Bihar.

I have a strong passion for programming ,with hands-on experience in Python, C, and C++. My core domain strengths include Digital Image Processing, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Computer Networking, and IoT. I love exploring new concepts, analyzing data, and solving challenging technical problems.

As part of my academic journey, I developed a project titled “Fertilizer Recommendation System Using Random Forest”, which enhanced my understanding of ML algorithms, image processing, and real-world applications.

Beyond technical skills, I enjoy writing and painting, which help me stay creative and balanced.

I am currently focused on building my career in data science, AI/ML, data-driven roles, and other IT domains, where I can contribute meaningfully and grow professionally.

I’m always open to collaborating, learning, and connecting with like-minded professionals.
Let’s innovate, grow, and move forward together!
